# To Do

* [X] declaring pairs should be enough to implicitly declare atoms
* [ ] allow default / unnamed component, actions without component
* [ ] implement moves on state enter, exit
* [ ] build transitions view that links states with events
* [ ] implement path syntax, abolish sigils
* [ ] implement payloads for events
* [ ] implement valued states
* [ ] use unified, indexed values for journal status, display differently in custom journal view according
  to journalling mode
* [ ] 1. introduce machine ID or similar measure so any number of state machines can be implemented within
  the same tables
* [ ] 2. parse transition phrases using a state machine
* [ ] 3. profit
* [ ] record phrasid in journal to indicate which transition phrase was activated
